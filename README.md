# AudioCaptcha

Generate highly secure, accessible audio CAPTCHAs. Human recognizable but bot-resistant audio challenges with sequences of spoken characters and sophisticated obfuscation techniques.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tn3w/audiocaptcha.git
cd audiocaptcha/characters
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional: python generate_dataset.py (to generate a new dataset)
python generate_captcha.py
```

## Overview

AudioCaptcha is a Python library for generating audio CAPTCHA challenges that are accessible to humans but difficult for bots to solve. The library provides various types of audio challenges with customizable difficulty levels and obfuscation techniques to enhance security while maintaining accessibility.

This is a Prove of Concept implementation intended to be used for a Rust implementation for the LibreCap project.
